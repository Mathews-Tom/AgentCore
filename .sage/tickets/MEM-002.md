# MEM-002: Create COMPASS-Enhanced Database Migration

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P0
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Week 1-2)
**Effort:** 8 story points

## Description

Implement Alembic migration for stage_memories, task_contexts, error_records, compression_metrics tables with PGVector extension

**Phase:** Phase 1: Foundation + Hierarchical Organization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PGVector extension added to PostgreSQL
- [ ] All 5 COMPASS tables created (memories, stage_memories, task_contexts, error_records, compression_metrics)
- [ ] Composite indexes created for stage + agent + task queries
- [ ] IVFFlat vector indexes configured for embedding similarity
- [ ] Migration reversible (downgrade tested)
- [ ] Seed data loads successfully

## Dependencies

- Parent: MEM-001 (Memory System Epic)
- Depends on: MEM-001

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**
  - `alembic/versions/XXX_add_compass_memory_tables.py`
  - `docker-compose.dev.yml`

**Estimated Duration:** 8 story points (~3-5 days)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new functions (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests where applicable (latency, throughput)
- COMPASS validation criteria embedded in acceptance tests

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md)
- **Epic Ticket:** [MEM-001](.sage/tickets/MEM-001.md)

## Notes

This task is part of the COMPASS-enhanced Memory System implementation, targeting:
- 60-80% context efficiency improvement
- +20% long-horizon task accuracy
- 70-80% cost reduction via test-time scaling
- 95%+ compression information retention
