# MEM-026: Implement Stage-Specific Context Formatting

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P1
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 4 (Week 7-8)
**Effort:** 3 story points

## Description

Format retrieved context based on current reasoning stage

**Phase:** Phase 4: Enhanced Retrieval

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Planning stage: goals, constraints, strategies
- [ ] Execution stage: actions, tools, immediate context
- [ ] Reflection stage: outcomes, learnings, insights
- [ ] Verification stage: results, validations, comparisons
- [ ] Format includes stage headers and structure
- [ ] Unit tests for formatting logic

## Dependencies

- Parent: MEM-001 (Memory System Epic)
- Depends on: MEM-025

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**
  - `src/agentcore/memory/context_formatter.py`
  - `tests/memory/unit/test_context_formatting.py`

**Estimated Duration:** 3 story points (~2-2 days)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new functions (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests where applicable (latency, throughput)
- COMPASS validation criteria embedded in acceptance tests

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md)
- **Epic Ticket:** [MEM-001](.sage/tickets/MEM-001.md)

## Notes

This task is part of the COMPASS-enhanced Memory System implementation, targeting:
- 60-80% context efficiency improvement
- +20% long-horizon task accuracy
- 70-80% cost reduction via test-time scaling
- 95%+ compression information retention
