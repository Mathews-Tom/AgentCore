# ACE-006: Implement Playbook Manager

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P0
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Week 1-2)
**Effort:** 8 story points

## Description

Create PlaybookManager for context playbook CRUD operations and version management

**Phase:** Phase 1: Foundation + Original ACE Core

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] create_playbook(agent_id, initial_sections) creates new playbook
- [ ] get_playbook(agent_id) retrieves current version
- [ ] apply_deltas(playbook_id, deltas) updates playbook with version increment
- [ ] Optimistic locking for version conflicts
- [ ] Playbook versioning tracked
- [ ] Unit tests for playbook lifecycle (95%+ coverage)

## Dependencies

- Parent: ACE-001
- Depends on: ACE-005

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**

- `src/agentcore/ace/context/playbook.py`
- `tests/ace/unit/test_playbook_manager.py`

**Estimated Duration:** 8 story points (~3-4 days)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for CRUD operations (95%+ coverage)
- Version conflict testing
- Integration tests with database

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/ace-integration/spec.md](../../docs/specs/ace-integration/spec.md) (FR-ACE-001 to FR-ACE-003)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/ace-integration/plan.md](../../docs/specs/ace-integration/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/ace-integration/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/ace-integration/tasks.md)

## Notes

Context Playbook is the core of ACE's self-supervised learning:

- Tracks agent strategies, patterns, failures, learnings
- Evolves through delta application
- Version tracking prevents conflicts
