# ACE-026: Implement Fitness Scoring

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P0
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 3 (Week 6)
**Effort:** 5 story points

## Description

Add multi-factor fitness scoring algorithm

**Phase:** Phase 5: Capability Evaluation (COMPASS ACE-4)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Capability coverage score (task requirements met)
- [ ] Performance history score (success rate on similar tasks)
- [ ] Resource efficiency score (time/cost per task)
- [ ] Combined fitness score with weighted factors
- [ ] Fitness trends tracked over time
- [ ] Unit tests for scoring algorithms

## Dependencies

- Parent: ACE-001
- Depends on: ACE-025

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**

- `src/agentcore/ace/capability/evaluator.py`
- `tests/ace/unit/test_fitness_scoring.py`

**Estimated Duration:** 5 story points

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for workflows
- Performance validation where applicable
- COMPASS validation for benchmarks (ACE-030)

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/ace-integration/spec.md](../../docs/specs/ace-integration/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/ace-integration/plan.md](../../docs/specs/ace-integration/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/ace-integration/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/ace-integration/tasks.md)

## Notes

Multi-factor fitness scoring for capability matching
