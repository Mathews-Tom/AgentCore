# MEM-035: Set Up Monitoring and Alerting

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P1
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 5 (Week 9-10)
**Effort:** 2 story points

## Description

Configure Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards

**Phase:** Phase 6: Optimization + COMPASS Validation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Metrics: retrieval latency, compression cost, memory count, error rate
- [ ] Grafana dashboard for memory system health
- [ ] Alerts: high latency, budget exhaustion, quality degradation
- [ ] Metric retention: 30 days
- [ ] Alert routing to on-call engineer

## Dependencies

- Parent: MEM-001 (Memory System Epic)
- Depends on: MEM-034

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**
  - `prometheus/memory_metrics.yml`
  - `grafana/memory_dashboard.json`

**Estimated Duration:** 2 story points (~1-2 days)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new functions (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests where applicable (latency, throughput)
- COMPASS validation criteria embedded in acceptance tests

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md)
- **Epic Ticket:** [MEM-001](.sage/tickets/MEM-001.md)

## Notes

This task is part of the COMPASS-enhanced Memory System implementation, targeting:
- 60-80% context efficiency improvement
- +20% long-horizon task accuracy
- 70-80% cost reduction via test-time scaling
- 95%+ compression information retention
