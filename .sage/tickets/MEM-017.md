# MEM-017: Add Compression Caching in Redis

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P1
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 3 (Week 5-6)
**Effort:** 3 story points

## Description

Cache compressed summaries in Redis (24h TTL) to reduce repeated compressions

**Phase:** Phase 2: Test-Time Scaling Compression

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Stage summaries cached by stage_id
- [ ] Task summaries cached by task_id
- [ ] Cache TTL configurable (default 24h)
- [ ] Cache invalidation on stage/task updates
- [ ] Cache hit rate tracked (target >60%)
- [ ] Integration tests with Redis

## Dependencies

- Parent: MEM-001 (Memory System Epic)
- Depends on: MEM-016

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**
  - `src/agentcore/memory/compression_cache.py`
  - `tests/memory/integration/test_compression_cache.py`

**Estimated Duration:** 3 story points (~2-2 days)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new functions (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests where applicable (latency, throughput)
- COMPASS validation criteria embedded in acceptance tests

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md)
- **Epic Ticket:** [MEM-001](.sage/tickets/MEM-001.md)

## Notes

This task is part of the COMPASS-enhanced Memory System implementation, targeting:
- 60-80% context efficiency improvement
- +20% long-horizon task accuracy
- 70-80% cost reduction via test-time scaling
- 95%+ compression information retention
