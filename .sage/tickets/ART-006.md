# ART-006: Autonomous Agent Framework

**State:** COMPLETED
**Priority:** P1
**Type:** implementation
**Effort:** 8 story points (5-8 days)
**Sprint:** 2
**Owner:** Senior Developer

## Description

Goal-oriented task execution with self-directed learning

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Goal-oriented task execution
- [x] Self-directed learning capabilities
- [x] Long-term memory and context retention
- [x] Decision lineage tracking

## Dependencies

- #ART-004 (parent)

## Context

**Specs:** `/Users/druk/WorkSpace/AetherForge/AgentCore/docs/specs/agent-runtime/spec.md`
**Plans:** `/Users/druk/WorkSpace/AetherForge/AgentCore/docs/specs/agent-runtime/plan.md`
**Tasks:** `/Users/druk/WorkSpace/AetherForge/AgentCore/docs/specs/agent-runtime/tasks.md`

## Progress

**Branch:** feature/agent-runtime-layer (not merged, work in progress)
**Notes:** Implementation in `engines/autonomous_engine.py`, `engines/autonomous_models.py`. 15 tests passing (100%). Goal-oriented task execution with priority levels (low, medium, high, critical), complex goal decomposition into sub-goals, execution plan generation with step-by-step execution, decision lineage tracking with rationale and confidence scores, long-term and working memory systems (episodic, semantic, procedural), learning experience recording with lesson extraction, goal progress tracking and status transitions, memory access tracking and importance scoring, success criteria evaluation, context retention with configurable limits.
