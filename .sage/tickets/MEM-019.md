# MEM-019: Performance Benchmarking

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P1
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 3 (Week 5-6)
**Effort:** 3 story points

## Description

Benchmark compression latency, cost, and quality across 1000 compressions

**Phase:** Phase 2: Test-Time Scaling Compression

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Latency: <5s (p95) for stage compression
- [ ] Cost: <$0.01 per stage compression (gpt-4o-mini pricing)
- [ ] Quality: >95% information retention (COMPASS target)
- [ ] Compression ratio: 9-11x for stages, 4-6x for tasks
- [ ] Load tests with 100 concurrent compressions
- [ ] Performance report generated

## Dependencies

- Parent: MEM-001 (Memory System Epic)
- Depends on: MEM-018

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**
  - `tests/memory/load/test_compression_performance.py`
  - `docs/memory-compression-performance-report.md`

**Estimated Duration:** 3 story points (~2-2 days)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new functions (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests where applicable (latency, throughput)
- COMPASS validation criteria embedded in acceptance tests

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md)
- **Epic Ticket:** [MEM-001](.sage/tickets/MEM-001.md)

## Notes

This task is part of the COMPASS-enhanced Memory System implementation, targeting:
- 60-80% context efficiency improvement
- +20% long-horizon task accuracy
- 70-80% cost reduction via test-time scaling
- 95%+ compression information retention
