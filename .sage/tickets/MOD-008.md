## Implementation Summary

**Completed:** 2025-11-11T19:30:00Z
**Status:** COMPLETED

### Work Performed

MOD-008 was created to ensure unit test coverage for Interfaces and Base Classes defined in MOD-002 and MOD-003. Upon investigation, comprehensive test suites were already created and committed as part of those tickets:

**Test Files:**
- `tests/modular/test_interfaces.py` (22 tests) - Created with MOD-002
- `tests/modular/test_base.py` (16 tests) - Created with MOD-003

**Total Coverage:** 38 tests, 100% pass rate

**Test Categories:**
1. Planner Models (4 tests)
2. Executor Models (4 tests)
3. Verifier Models (4 tests)
4. Generator Models (4 tests)
5. Protocol Interfaces (4 tests)
6. Interface Imports (2 tests)
7. Module State (2 tests)
8. Base Module (3 tests)
9. Base Planner (4 tests)
10. Base Executor (2 tests)
11. Base Verifier (3 tests)
12. Base Generator (2 tests)

**Verification:**
```bash
uv run pytest tests/modular/test_interfaces.py tests/modular/test_base.py -v
# Result: 38 passed in 2.04s
```

### Acceptance Criteria

✓ All interface models have validation tests
✓ All base class implementations have functional tests
✓ Protocol interfaces can be used as type hints
✓ All tests passing (100% pass rate)
✓ Proper error handling tested
✓ Context propagation tested
✓ State management tested

### Related Commits

- `24e2915` - feat(modular): #MOD-002 define module interface protocols (includes test_interfaces.py)
- `ae04475` - feat(modular): #MOD-003 implement base module classes (includes test_base.py)

### Notes

This ticket was completed implicitly through MOD-002 and MOD-003 implementation. The test files were included in those commits, providing comprehensive coverage for all interface protocols and base classes. No additional work was required.
