# MEM-021: Implement Hybrid Search (Vector + Graph)

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P0
**Type:** Story
**Component:** memory-system
**Sprint:** 3
**Effort:** 13 SP

## Description

Implement hybrid search combining Qdrant vector search with Neo4j graph traversal

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Vector search in Qdrant for semantic similarity
- [ ] Graph traversal in Neo4j for contextual relationships
- [ ] Merge and rank results from both databases
- [ ] Relationship-based relevance boosting
- [ ] Graph proximity scoring
- [ ] <300ms hybrid search latency (p95)
- [ ] 90%+ retrieval precision (target)
- [ ] Integration tests with both databases

## Dependencies

- #MEM-001 (parent epic)

**Tasks:** docs/specs/memory-service/tasks.md

## Effort

**Story Points:** 13
**Sprint:** 3 (of 4 sprints, 8 weeks total)

## Progress

**Notes:** Generated from /sage.tasks command for hybrid architecture
