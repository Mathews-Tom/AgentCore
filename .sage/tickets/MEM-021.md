# MEM-021: Implement Error Pattern Detection

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P0
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 3 (Week 5-6)
**Effort:** 5 story points

## Description

Add pattern detection to identify recurring error types (2+ occurrences)

**Phase:** Phase 3: Error Tracking

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] detect_patterns(task_id, lookback_stages) groups errors
- [ ] Common context extraction from error descriptions
- [ ] Pattern severity: avg(error_severity) * occurrences
- [ ] Recommendations generated for pattern mitigation
- [ ] Compounding error detection (related errors in sequence)
- [ ] Unit tests for pattern detection algorithms

## Dependencies

- Parent: MEM-001 (Memory System Epic)
- Depends on: MEM-020

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**
  - `src/agentcore/memory/pattern_detector.py`
  - `tests/memory/unit/test_pattern_detector.py`

**Estimated Duration:** 5 story points (~2-3 days)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new functions (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests where applicable (latency, throughput)
- COMPASS validation criteria embedded in acceptance tests

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md)
- **Epic Ticket:** [MEM-001](.sage/tickets/MEM-001.md)

## Notes

This task is part of the COMPASS-enhanced Memory System implementation, targeting:
- 60-80% context efficiency improvement
- +20% long-horizon task accuracy
- 70-80% cost reduction via test-time scaling
- 95%+ compression information retention
