# MEM-036: Write Operational Documentation

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P0
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 5 (Week 9-10)
**Effort:** 2 story points

## Description

Create runbook and API documentation for operations and developers

**Phase:** Phase 6: Optimization + COMPASS Validation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Runbook: deployment, troubleshooting, common issues
- [ ] API docs: JSON-RPC methods, examples, error codes
- [ ] Architecture diagram: component interactions
- [ ] Configuration guide: all settings explained
- [ ] COMPASS validation results included
- [ ] Production readiness checklist completed

## Dependencies

- Parent: MEM-001 (Memory System Epic)
- Depends on: MEM-035

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**
  - `docs/memory-system-runbook.md`
  - `docs/memory-system-api.md`
  - `docs/memory-architecture.md`

**Estimated Duration:** 2 story points (~1-2 days)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new functions (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests where applicable (latency, throughput)
- COMPASS validation criteria embedded in acceptance tests

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md)
- **Epic Ticket:** [MEM-001](.sage/tickets/MEM-001.md)

## Notes

This task is part of the COMPASS-enhanced Memory System implementation, targeting:
- 60-80% context efficiency improvement
- +20% long-horizon task accuracy
- 70-80% cost reduction via test-time scaling
- 95%+ compression information retention
