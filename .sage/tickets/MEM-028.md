# MEM-028: Implement Performance Validation

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P0
**Type:** Story
**Component:** memory-system
**Sprint:** 4
**Effort:** 5 SP

## Description

Validate all performance targets and conduct benchmarking

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Vector search: <100ms (p95) with 1M vectors
- [ ] Graph traversal: <200ms (p95, 2-hop) with 100K nodes
- [ ] Hybrid search: <300ms (p95) combined
- [ ] Stage compression: <5s (p95)
- [ ] Memify optimization: <5s per 1000 entities
- [ ] Context efficiency: 60-80% reduction validated
- [ ] Cost reduction: 70-80% validated
- [ ] Entity extraction: 80%+ accuracy
- [ ] Relationship detection: 75%+ accuracy
