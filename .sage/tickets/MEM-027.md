# MEM-027: A/B Testing vs Baseline Retrieval

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P1
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 4 (Week 7-8)
**Effort:** 5 story points

## Description

Compare enhanced retrieval (5-factor) against baseline (embedding-only)

**Phase:** Phase 4: Enhanced Retrieval

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test dataset: 1000 queries with ground truth
- [ ] Metrics: precision@5, recall@10, NDCG@10
- [ ] Enhanced retrieval shows >10% improvement
- [ ] Latency overhead <20ms per query
- [ ] A/B test report with statistical significance

## Dependencies

- Parent: MEM-001 (Memory System Epic)
- Depends on: MEM-026

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**
  - `tests/memory/integration/test_enhanced_retrieval.py`
  - `docs/memory-retrieval-comparison-report.md`

**Estimated Duration:** 5 story points (~2-3 days)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new functions (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests where applicable (latency, throughput)
- COMPASS validation criteria embedded in acceptance tests

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md)
- **Epic Ticket:** [MEM-001](.sage/tickets/MEM-001.md)

## Notes

This task is part of the COMPASS-enhanced Memory System implementation, targeting:
- 60-80% context efficiency improvement
- +20% long-horizon task accuracy
- 70-80% cost reduction via test-time scaling
- 95%+ compression information retention
