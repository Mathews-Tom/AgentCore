# MEM-022: Implement Graph-Aware Context Expansion

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P1
**Type:** Story
**Component:** memory-system
**Sprint:** 3
**Effort:** 3 SP

## Description

Implement context expansion using graph relationships for retrieval results

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] For each vector result, traverse Neo4j for related entities
- [ ] Include 1-hop neighbors (direct connections)
- [ ] Include 2-hop neighbors for critical memories
- [ ] Preserve graph structure in context
- [ ] Entity → relationship → entity format
- [ ] Integration tests with hybrid search

## Dependencies

- #MEM-001 (parent epic)
