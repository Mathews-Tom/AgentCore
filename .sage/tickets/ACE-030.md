# ACE-030: COMPASS Validation Tests

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P0
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 4 (Week 7-8)
**Effort:** 5 story points

## Description

Validate against COMPASS benchmarks (accuracy, recall, precision, cost)

**Phase:** Phase 6: Production Readiness

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Long-horizon accuracy: +20% improvement on GAIA-style tasks
- [ ] Critical error recall: 90%+ on test dataset
- [ ] Intervention precision: 85%+ correct intervention rate
- [ ] Cost reduction: Within $150/month budget (100 agents)
- [ ] All COMPASS targets met or documented deviations
- [ ] Validation report with statistical analysis

## Dependencies

- Parent: ACE-001
- Depends on: ACE-029

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**

- `tests/ace/validation/test_compass_benchmarks.py`
- `docs/ace-compass-validation-report.md`

**Estimated Duration:** 5 story points

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for workflows
- Performance validation where applicable
- COMPASS validation for benchmarks (ACE-030)

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/ace-integration/spec.md](../../docs/specs/ace-integration/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/ace-integration/plan.md](../../docs/specs/ace-integration/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/ace-integration/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/ace-integration/tasks.md)

## Notes

CRITICAL: COMPASS validation ensures research targets met
