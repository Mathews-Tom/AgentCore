# MEM-006: Implement StageManager Core

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P0
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Week 1-2)
**Effort:** 5 story points

## Description

Create StageManager class for stage lifecycle (create, add, complete) with stage type validation

**Phase:** Phase 1: Foundation + Hierarchical Organization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] create_stage(task_id, stage_type) validates stage enum
- [ ] add_to_stage(stage_id, memory_id) links memory to stage
- [ ] complete_stage(stage_id) triggers compression preparation
- [ ] Stage transitions tracked in TaskContext.current_stage_id
- [ ] Stage type enum: planning, execution, reflection, verification
- [ ] Unit tests for stage lifecycle (95%+ coverage)

## Dependencies

- Parent: MEM-001 (Memory System Epic)
- Depends on: MEM-005

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**
  - `src/agentcore/memory/stage_manager.py`
  - `tests/memory/unit/test_stage_operations.py`

**Estimated Duration:** 5 story points (~2-3 days)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new functions (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests where applicable (latency, throughput)
- COMPASS validation criteria embedded in acceptance tests

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md)
- **Epic Ticket:** [MEM-001](.sage/tickets/MEM-001.md)

## Notes

This task is part of the COMPASS-enhanced Memory System implementation, targeting:
- 60-80% context efficiency improvement
- +20% long-horizon task accuracy
- 70-80% cost reduction via test-time scaling
- 95%+ compression information retention
