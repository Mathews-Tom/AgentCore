# ACE-017: Implement Intervention Decision Making

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P0
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 2 (Week 4)
**Effort:** 8 story points

## Description

Add decision logic using gpt-4.1 for intervention type selection

**Phase:** Phase 3: Strategic Intervention Engine (COMPASS ACE-2)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] decide_intervention(trigger, strategic_context) returns InterventionDecision
- [ ] Uses gpt-4.1 for strategic decisions (accuracy-critical)
- [ ] Decision includes rationale and expected impact
- [ ] Decision latency <200ms (p95)
- [ ] Decision accuracy 85%+ (validated against ground truth)
- [ ] Integration tests with mocked Portkey

## Dependencies

- Parent: ACE-001
- Depends on: ACE-016

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**

- `src/agentcore/ace/intervention/decision.py`
- `tests/ace/integration/test_intervention_decision.py`

**Estimated Duration:** 8 story points

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for workflows
- Performance validation where applicable

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/ace-integration/spec.md](../../docs/specs/ace-integration/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/ace-integration/plan.md](../../docs/specs/ace-integration/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/ace-integration/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/ace-integration/tasks.md)

## Notes

Uses gpt-4.1 for strategic accuracy (vs gpt-4o-mini for deltas)
