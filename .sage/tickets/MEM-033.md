# MEM-033: Stress Test Compression Service

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P1
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 5 (Week 9-10)
**Effort:** 4 story points

## Description

Load test compression with 100 concurrent requests

**Phase:** Phase 6: Optimization + COMPASS Validation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 100 concurrent compressions without errors
- [ ] Queue processing time <10s per batch
- [ ] Memory usage <500MB under load
- [ ] CPU usage <80% under load
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents gpt-4o-mini quota exhaustion
- [ ] Load test report generated

## Dependencies

- Parent: MEM-001 (Memory System Epic)
- Depends on: MEM-032

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**
  - `tests/memory/load/test_compression_stress.py`
  - `docs/memory-load-test-report.md`

**Estimated Duration:** 4 story points (~2-3 days)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new functions (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests where applicable (latency, throughput)
- COMPASS validation criteria embedded in acceptance tests

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md)
- **Epic Ticket:** [MEM-001](.sage/tickets/MEM-001.md)

## Notes

This task is part of the COMPASS-enhanced Memory System implementation, targeting:
- 60-80% context efficiency improvement
- +20% long-horizon task accuracy
- 70-80% cost reduction via test-time scaling
- 95%+ compression information retention
