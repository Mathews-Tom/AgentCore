# MEM-034: COMPASS Validation Testing

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P0
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 5 (Week 9-10)
**Effort:** 5 story points

## Description

Validate against COMPASS benchmarks (context efficiency, accuracy, cost)

**Phase:** Phase 6: Optimization + COMPASS Validation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Context efficiency: 60-80% reduction achieved
- [ ] Long-horizon accuracy: +20% improvement on GAIA-style tasks
- [ ] Cost reduction: 70-80% via test-time scaling validated
- [ ] Compression quality: 95%+ information retention
- [ ] All COMPASS targets met or exceeded
- [ ] Validation report with statistical analysis

## Dependencies

- Parent: MEM-001 (Memory System Epic)
- Depends on: MEM-033

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**
  - `tests/memory/validation/test_compass_benchmarks.py`
  - `docs/memory-compass-validation-report.md`

**Estimated Duration:** 5 story points (~2-3 days)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new functions (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests where applicable (latency, throughput)
- COMPASS validation criteria embedded in acceptance tests

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md)
- **Epic Ticket:** [MEM-001](.sage/tickets/MEM-001.md)

## Notes

This task is part of the COMPASS-enhanced Memory System implementation, targeting:
- 60-80% context efficiency improvement
- +20% long-horizon task accuracy
- 70-80% cost reduction via test-time scaling
- 95%+ compression information retention
