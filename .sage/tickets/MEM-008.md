# MEM-008: Integrate StageManager with MemoryManager

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P0
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Week 1-2)
**Effort:** 8 story points

## Description

Update MemoryManager to be stage-aware and orchestrate stage operations

**Phase:** Phase 1: Foundation + Hierarchical Organization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] add_interaction() assigns memories to current stage
- [ ] get_stage_context() retrieves stage-filtered memories
- [ ] complete_stage() delegates to StageManager
- [ ] Stage transitions trigger appropriate hooks
- [ ] Backwards compatible with non-stage-aware agents
- [ ] Integration tests for stage-aware workflows

## Dependencies

- Parent: MEM-001 (Memory System Epic)
- Depends on: MEM-007

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**
  - `src/agentcore/memory/manager.py`
  - `tests/memory/integration/test_stage_manager.py`

**Estimated Duration:** 8 story points (~3-5 days)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new functions (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests where applicable (latency, throughput)
- COMPASS validation criteria embedded in acceptance tests

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md)
- **Epic Ticket:** [MEM-001](.sage/tickets/MEM-001.md)

## Notes

This task is part of the COMPASS-enhanced Memory System implementation, targeting:
- 60-80% context efficiency improvement
- +20% long-horizon task accuracy
- 70-80% cost reduction via test-time scaling
- 95%+ compression information retention
