# MEM-023: Implement Memify Graph Optimizer

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P0
**Type:** Story
**Component:** memory-system
**Sprint:** 4
**Effort:** 13 SP

## Description

Implement Memify operation for graph optimization (consolidation, pruning, pattern detection)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Entity consolidation: Merge similar entities with >90% similarity
- [ ] Relationship pruning: Remove low-value edges (access count < 2)
- [ ] Pattern detection: Identify frequently traversed paths
- [ ] Index optimization: Update Neo4j indexes based on query patterns
- [ ] Quality metrics: Track connectivity, relationship density
- [ ] <5s optimization per 1000 entities
- [ ] 90%+ consolidation accuracy
- [ ] <5% duplicate entities after optimization
- [ ] Scheduled execution support (cron)
- [ ] Unit tests for algorithms
