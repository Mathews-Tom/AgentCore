# MEM-023: Implement Enhanced Importance Scoring

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P0
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 4 (Week 7-8)
**Effort:** 8 story points

## Description

Add 5-factor importance scoring (embedding, recency, frequency, stage, criticality)

**Phase:** Phase 4: Enhanced Retrieval

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Embedding similarity (40% weight)
- [ ] Recency (20% weight, exponential decay 24h half-life)
- [ ] Frequency (15% weight, access count normalized)
- [ ] Stage relevance (15% weight, boost current stage)
- [ ] Criticality boost (10% weight, is_critical flag)
- [ ] Unit tests for each factor

## Dependencies

- Parent: MEM-001 (Memory System Epic)
- Depends on: MEM-022

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**
  - `src/agentcore/memory/retrieval.py`
  - `tests/memory/unit/test_enhanced_scoring.py`

**Estimated Duration:** 8 story points (~3-5 days)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new functions (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests where applicable (latency, throughput)
- COMPASS validation criteria embedded in acceptance tests

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md)
- **Epic Ticket:** [MEM-001](.sage/tickets/MEM-001.md)

## Notes

This task is part of the COMPASS-enhanced Memory System implementation, targeting:
- 60-80% context efficiency improvement
- +20% long-horizon task accuracy
- 70-80% cost reduction via test-time scaling
- 95%+ compression information retention
