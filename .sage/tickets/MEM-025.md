# MEM-025: Implement Criticality Boosting

**State:** UNPROCESSED
**Priority:** P1
**Type:** Story
**Sprint:** Sprint 4 (Week 7-8)
**Effort:** 3 story points

## Description

Add is_critical flag and criticality_reason for important memories

**Phase:** Phase 4: Enhanced Retrieval

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Critical memories flagged during storage
- [ ] Criticality boost: 1.5x importance score
- [ ] Error-related memories auto-flagged as critical
- [ ] Agent-specified critical constraints preserved
- [ ] Critical memory ratio tracked (target <10%)
- [ ] Integration tests for criticality

## Dependencies

- Parent: MEM-001 (Memory System Epic)
- Depends on: MEM-024

## Technical Details

**Owner:** Backend Engineer

**Files to modify/create:**
  - `src/agentcore/memory/criticality.py`
  - `tests/memory/integration/test_criticality.py`

**Estimated Duration:** 3 story points (~2-2 days)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new functions (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests where applicable (latency, throughput)
- COMPASS validation criteria embedded in acceptance tests

## Context

- **Specification:** [docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/spec.md)
- **Implementation Plan:** [docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/plan.md)
- **Task Breakdown:** [docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md](../../docs/specs/memory-system/tasks.md)
- **Epic Ticket:** [MEM-001](.sage/tickets/MEM-001.md)

## Notes

This task is part of the COMPASS-enhanced Memory System implementation, targeting:
- 60-80% context efficiency improvement
- +20% long-horizon task accuracy
- 70-80% cost reduction via test-time scaling
- 95%+ compression information retention
