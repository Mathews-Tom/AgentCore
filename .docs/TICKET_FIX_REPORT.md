## Reason for Correction

The previous sync operation incorrectly applied "markdown wins" rule for state fields,
resetting completed tickets to UNPROCESSED. This correction validates tickets against
git commit history - if a ticket has implementation commits, it should be COMPLETED.

## Next Steps

1. Review corrected ticket states above
2. Run `/sage.sync` to regenerate markdown files
3. Commit corrected ticket data
4. Continue with `/sage.implement` on remaining UNPROCESSED tickets
